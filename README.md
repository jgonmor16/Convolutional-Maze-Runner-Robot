ABOUT
----
The idea behind this proyect is to create a system able to control the movement
of a robot around its factory. This system, when given an starting and an
ending point, will:
* Take a "picture" of the currente status of the factory
* Then usean IA to codify it
* Run an A* Pathfinding Algorithm to find the shortest route
* Encode then
* Send then via Bluetooth to the robot
